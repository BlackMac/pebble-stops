pebble-stops
============

Pebble SDK 2.0 app to show nearest bus and train stops

This app will fetch train schedules for the nearest bus and train stops through the JSON API on m.bahn.de

In the current version it only fetches the ten nearest stops and no schedules.

The icon was designed with [Pixen](http://pixenapp.com/) and converted to a tiny PNG using [HyperDither](http://www.tinrocket.com/hyperdither/)
